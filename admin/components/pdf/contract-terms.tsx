      <Title>1. Relationship of the Parties:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Neither Party is the employee, agent or partner of the other Party nor,
        by virtue of this Customer Contract, is authorised to bind or represent
        the other Party. The Contractor must not represent itself, and must
        ensure that its officers, employees, agents or subcontractors do not
        represent themselves, as being an officer, employee, partner or agent of
        the Customer. In all dealings related to the Customer Contract, the
        Parties agree to
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (a) communicate openly with each other and cooperate in achieving the
        contractual objectives;
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>(b) act honestly and ethically; and</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (c) comply with reasonable commercial standards of fair conduct;
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (d) consult, co-operate and co-ordinate activities to identify and

        (e) when accessing any TASGovernment place, area or facility, the
        Contractor must comply with any security and safety requirements
        notified to the Contractor by the Customer or of which the Contractor
        is, or should reasonably be, aware. The Contractor must ensure that its
        officers, employees, agents and subcontractors are aware of, and comply
        with, such security and safety requirements. The Contractor must ensure
        that any material and property (including securityrelated devices and
        clearances) provided by the Customer for the purposes of the Customer
        Contract is protected at all times from unauthorised access, use by a
        third Party, misuse, damage and destruction and is returned as directed
        by the Customer
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>2. Entire Agreement:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The Customer Contract represents the Parties &apos; entire agreement in
        relation to the subject matter. Anything that occurred before the making
        of this Customer Contract shall be disregarded (unless incorporated into
        the Customer Contract in writing). No agreement or understanding varying
        or extending the Customer Contract is legally binding upon either Party
        unless in writing and agreed by both Parties. If either Party does not
        exercise (or delays in exercising) any of its contractual rights, that
        failure or delay does not operate to prejudice those rights.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>3. Precedence of Documents:</Title>
      <Paragraph>(a)The Customer Contract is comprised of:</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>(a) the Letter;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>(b) the Offer;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>(c) the Request;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>(d) these Simple Contract Terms; and</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (e) the Simple Contracting Terms Glossary as at 9:00am, Tasmaniatime, on
        the Commencement Date, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the
        Parties. If there is ambiguity or inconsistency between documents
        comprising the Customer Contract, the document appearing higher in the
        list will have precedence
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>4. Survival:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Clauses 9 [Liability of the Contractor and Insurance], 19 [Compliance
        with Laws] 20 [Compliance with TasmaniaPolicies], clause 22
        [Intellectual Property] and clause 23 [Pre-Existing Intellectual
        Property Rights] survive termination or expiry of the Customer Contract.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>5. Governing Law:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The laws of Tasmania Government apply to the Customer Contract and the
        Parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of that State
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>7. Assignment etc:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The Contractor may not assign any rights under the Customer Contract, or
        novate the Customer Contract without the Customer&apos;s written
        consent. To seek consent, the Contractor must provide the Customer with
        a Notice, which includes full details of the proposed assignment or
        novation and the rights the Contractor proposes to assign or novate. To
        decline consent, the Customer must provide a Notice to the Contractor,
        setting out its reasons, within twenty-eight (28) calendar days of
        receiving the Notice seeking consent. Otherwise, the Customer is taken
        to have consented.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>8. Subcontracting:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Subcontracting any part of, or the entire Contractor&apos;s obligations
        under the Customer Contract, will not relieve the Contractor from any of
        its obligations under the Customer Contract. Part 1F of the Civil
        Liability Act 2002 (TAS) is excluded. The Contractor must ensure that
        subcontractors specified in the Customer Contract (if any) perform that
        part
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>9. Liability of the Contractor and Insurance:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The Contractor will indemnify the Customer and its officers and
        employees against any claim, cost, damage, expense or loss arising out
        of or in connection with any act or omission or any breach of the
        Contractor&apos;s obligations or representations under the Customer
        Contract. The Contractor&apos;s obligation to indemnify the Customer and
        its officers and employees will reduce proportionally to the extent that
        any act or omission, on the part of the Customer or its officers and
        employees caused or contributed to the claim, cost, damage, expense or
        loss. The Customer agrees to use its best endeavours to cooperate with
        the Contractor, at the Contractor&apos;s expense, in respect of the
        conduct of any defence or the agreement of any settlement of any claim,
        demand or proceeding the subject of the indemnity under this clause. The
        Contractor will maintain public liability insurance, workers&apos;
        compensation insurance (including common law liability) and any other
        insurance consistent with good industry practice a prudent Contractor
        would reasonably require in connection with the Products and/or Services
        under the Customer Contract and provide the Customer with proof of
        insurance upon request.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>10. Delivery and Acceptance:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The Contractor must provide the Products and/or Services as specified in
        the Customer Contract and meet any requirements and standard specified
        in the Customer Contract. The Contractor must promptly notify the
        Customer if the Contractor becomes aware that it will be unable to
        provide all or part of the Products and/or Services specified in the
        Contract and advise the Customer when it will be able to so. Any
        Products must be delivered free from any security interest. Unless
        otherwise stated, Products must be new and unused. Any Services must be
        provided to the higher of the standard that would be expected of an
        experienced, professional Contractor of similar services and any
        standard specified in the Customer Contract. The Customer may reject the
        Products and/or Services within fourteen (14) calendar days after
        delivery if the Products and/or Services do not comply with the
        requirements of the Customer Contract. If the Customer does not notify
        the Contractor of rejection within the fourteen (14) calendar day
        period, the Customer will be taken to have accepted the Products and/or
        Services, though the Customer may accept the Products and/or
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>11. Termination for Cause:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Because once the contract is signed, the customer cannot terminate the
        contract because of a change of mind. MY IT STUDIO has already started
        to provide services.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The Customer may terminate the Customer Contract in whole or in part if:
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (a) the Contractor does not deliver the Products and/or Services as
        specified in the Customer Contract, or notifies the Customer that the
        Contractor will be unable to deliver the Products and/or Services as
        specified in the Customer Contract;
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (b) the Customer rejects the Products and/or Services in accordance with
        clause 10 [Delivery and Acceptance] and the Products and/or Services are
        not remedied as required by the Notice of rejection;
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        If the contract is terminated, MY IT STUDIO will not refund the deposit.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>12. Termination or Reduction for Convenience:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        In addition to any other rights either Party has under the Customer
        Contract,
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (a) the Customer acting in good faith, may at any time; or
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (b) the Contractor, acting in good faith, may notify that it wishes to,
        terminate the Customer Contract or reduce the scope or quantity of the
        Products and/or Services by providing a Notice to the other Party. If
        the Contractor issues a Notice under this clause, the Contractor must
        comply with any reasonable directions given by the Customer. The
        Customer Contract will terminate, or the scope will be reduced in
        accordance with the Notice, when the Contractor has complied with all of
        those directions. If the Customer issues a Notice under this clause, the
        Contractor must stop or reduce work in accordance with the Notice and
        comply with any reasonable directions given by the Customer. In either
        case, the Contractor must mitigate all loss and expenses in connection
        with the termination or reduction in scope (including the costs of its
        compliance with any directions). The Customer will pay the Contractor
        for Products and/or
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Services accepted in accordance with the Acceptance clause of the
        Customer Contract, before the effective date of termination or
        reduction. If the Customer issues a Notice under this clause, the
        Customer will also pay the Contractor for any reasonable costs the
        Contractor incurs that are directly attributable to the termination or
        reduction, provided the Contractor substantiates these costs to the
        satisfaction of the Customer. Under no circumstances will the total of
        all payments to the Contractor exceed the Contract Price. The Contractor
        will not be entitled to loss of anticipated profit for any part of the
        Customer Contract not performed.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>13. Dispute Resolution:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        For any dispute arising under the Customer Contract both the Contractor
        and the Customer agree to comply with (a) to (d) of this clause
        sequentially:
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (a) both Contract Managers will try to settle the dispute by direct
        negotiation;
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (b) if unresolved, the Contract Manager claiming that there is a dispute
        will give the other Contract Manager a Notice setting out details of the
        dispute and proposing a solution;
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (c) if the proposed solution is not accepted by the other Contract
        Manager within five (5) business days, each Contract Manager will
        nominate a more senior representative, who has not had prior direct
        involvement in the dispute. These representatives will try to settle the
        dispute by direct negotiation;
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (d) If the dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) calendar days,
        either the Contractor and the Customer may commence legal proceedings.
        Despite the existence of a dispute, the Contractor will (unless
        requested in writing by the Customer not to do so) continue their
        performance under the Customer Contract. This procedure for dispute
        resolution does not apply to action relating to Termination for Cause
        under clause 11 or to legal proceedings for urgent interlocutory relief.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>14. Specified Personnel:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The Contractor must ensure that the Specified Personnel set out in the
        Contract (if any) perform that part of the Services so specified. The
        Contractor must ensure that Specified Personnel (if any) are not
        replaced without the prior written consent of the Customer. At the
        Customer&apos;s request, the Contractor, at no additional cost to the
        Customer, must promptly replace any Specified Personnel that the
        Customer reasonably considers should be replaced with personnel
        acceptable to the Customer.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>15. Licences Approvals and Warranties:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The Contractor must obtain and maintain all licenses or other approvals
        required for the lawful provision of the Products and/or Services and
        arrange any necessary customs entry for any Products. To the extent
        permitted by laws and for the benefit of the Customer, the Contractor
        consents, and must use its best endeavours to ensure that each author of
        Material consents in writing, to the use by the Customer of the
        Material, even if the use may otherwise be an infringement of their
        Moral Rights. The Contractor must provide the Customer with all relevant
        third Party warranties in respect of Products. If the Contractor is a
        manufacturer, the Contractor must provide the Customer with all standard
        manufacturer&apos;s warranties in respect of the Products it has
        manufactured and supplied. The Contractor warrants and represents to the
        Contract Authority and the Customer that any &quot;Lobbyist&quot;
        irculars that it or any of its officers, employees, agents or
        subcontractors has employed, engaged or has otherwise involved, directly
        or indirectly, in connection with the Customer Contract, is duly
        registered as a &quot;Lobbyist&quot; in terms of that Public Sector

      <Title>16. Invoice:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        If the Contractor is required to submit an invoice to trigger payment,
        the invoice must be a Correctly Rendered Invoice. The Contractor must
        promptly provide to the Customer such supporting documentation and other
        evidence reasonably required by the Customer to substantiate performance
        of the Customer Contract by the Contractor. Payment of any invoice is
        not evidence that the obligations under the Customer Contract are
        accepted, evidence of the value of the obligations performed by the
        Contractor, or an admission of liability, but is payment on account
        only. If the Contractor owes any amount to the Customer in connection
        with the Customer Contract, the Customer may offset that amount, or part
        of it, against its obligation to pay any Correctly Rendered Invoice.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>17. Payment:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The Customer must pay the amount of a Correctly Rendered Invoice to the
        Contractor within twenty (20) calendar days after receiving it, or if
        this day is not a business day, on the next business day. The Customer
        may pay the amount specified in a Correctly Rendered Invoice by:
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>(a) cash;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>(b) cheque;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (c) electronic funds transfer to the account with a financial
        institution nominated by the Contractor; or
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (d) credit card. The Contractor must not impose a surcharge on the
        Customer for payment by credit card.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>18. Notices:</Title>
      <Paragraph>A Notice is deemed to be effected:</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (a) If delivered by hand - upon delivery to the relevant address;
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (b) If sent by registered post - upon delivery to the relevant address;
        or
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (c) If transmitted electronically - upon actual delivery as evidenced by
        a delivery receipt by the addressee. A Notice received after 5.00 pm, or
        on a day that is not a working day in the place of receipt, is deemed to
        be effected on the next working day in that place.
      </Paragraph>

      <Title>19. Compliance with Laws:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The Contractor must comply with, and ensure its officers, employees,
        agents and subcontractors comply with the laws from time to time in
        force in any jurisdiction in which any part of the Customer Contract is
        performed.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>20. Compliance with TasmaniaPolicies:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The Contractor must comply with, and ensure its officers, employees,
        agents and subcontractors comply with all Tasmaniapolicies relevant to
        the Products and/or Services. If the Contractor becomes aware of any
        actual or suspected breach of the requirements set out in clauses A to C
        below, it must:
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (a) immediately report it to the Customer and provide a written report
        on the matter within five (5) business days; and
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (b) comply with any reasonable directions by the Customer in relation to
        any investigation or further reporting of the actual or suspected
        breach.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        A. Access to Contractor&apos;s Premises and Records: The Contractor must
        maintain proper business and accounting records relating to the supply
        of the Products and/or Services and performance of the Customer
        Contract. The Contractor agrees to give the Customer, or its nominee,
        access to the Contractor&apos;s, or its subcontractor&apos;s premises,
        personnel, documents and other records, and all assistance reasonably
        requested, for any purpose associated with the Customer Contract or any
        review of the Contractor&apos;s or the Customer&apos;s performance under
        the Contract. This will include, but is not limited to, in connection
        with a request made under the Freedom of Information Act 1992 or audit
        or review by the Office of the Auditor General Australia. Unless the
        access is required for the purpose of a criminal investigation into the
        Contractor, its employees or subcontractors, the Customer will reimburse
        the Contractor&apos;s substantiated reasonable cost for complying with
        the Customer&apos;s requires. The Contractor must not transfer, or
        permit the transfer of, custody or ownership, or allow the destruction,
        of any record (as defined in the State Records Act 2000) without the
        prior written consent of the Customer. All records, including any held
        by subcontractors, must be returned to the Customer at the conclusion of
        the Contract.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        B. Confidential Information: The Contractor agrees not to disclose to
        any person, other than the Customer, any confidential information
        relating to the Customer Contract or the Products and/or Services,
        without prior written approval from the Customer. This obligation will
        not be breached where the Contractor is required by law or a stock
        exchange to disclose the relevant information. If, at any time, the
        Customer requires, the Contractor is to arrange for its employees,
        agents or subcontractors to give a written undertaking relating to
        nondisclosure of the Customer&apos;s confidential information in a form
        acceptable to the Customer. The Contractor acknowledges that
        unauthorised disclosure of official information is an offence.
        Legislation (including, but not limited to, the Criminal Code Act
        Compilation Act 1913) contains provisions relating to the protection of
        prescribed official information and sets out the penalties for the
        unauthorised disclosure of that information.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        C. Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) Requirements: In providing the Products and/or
        Services, the Contractor agrees to comply, and to ensure that its
        officers, employees, agents and subcontractors comply with the Privacy
        Act 1988 (Cth) and not to do anything would breach an Australian Privacy
        Principle as defined in that Act.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>21. Police Clearance:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The Customer may request the Contractor, at any time and from time to
        time, to obtain and provide it with an Australia- wide police clearance
        in respect of any of the Contractor&apos;s officers, employees, agents
        and subcontractors. The Contractor must comply with that request within
        thirty (30) calendar days of such request. If any police clearance
        evidences that any of the Contractor&apos;s officers, employees, agents
        and subcontractors has committed a criminal offence punishable by
        imprisonment or detention, then the Customer may, without prejudice to
        their other rights under the Customer Contract, request the Contractor
        to promptly remove that Contractor&apos;s officers, employees, agents
        and subcontractors from involvement in the Customer Contract. If the
        Contractor is requested to remove any of the Contractor&apos;s officers,
        employees, agents and subcontractors under this clause, the Contractor
        must, at its own cost, promptly remove that person from all involvement
        in the Customer Contract and arrange for a replacement of that person.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>22. Intellectual Property:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Unless otherwise indicated in the Customer Contract, the Contractor owns
        the Intellectual Property Rights in the Material created under the
        Customer Contract. The Contractor grants to the Customer:
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (a) a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, perpetual, world-wide
        licence to exercise the Intellectual Property Rights in the Material
        provided under the Customer Contract for any purpose; and
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        (b) a right to sub-licence the rights in (a), above to third parties,
        including to the public under an open access or Creative Commons
        &apos;BY&apos; licence. The licence excludes the right of commercial
        exploitation by the Customer. The Contractor warrants that it is
        entitled to grant this licence, and that the provision of the Products
        and/or Services and any Material under this Customer Contract, and its
        use by the Customer in accordance with this Customer Contract, will not
        infringe any third Party&apos;s intellectual property rights.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title>23. Pre-existing Intellectual Property Rights:</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        The Contractor grants to, or in the case of ThirdParty Material, must
        obtain for, the Customer a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free,
        perpetual, world-wide licence (including the right to sub licence) to
        exercise the Intellectual Property Rights in all Pre-existing Material
        and Third Party Material incorporated into the Material to enable the
        Customer to receive the full benefit of the Products and/or Services and
        the Material and to exercise its rights in relation to the Material.
